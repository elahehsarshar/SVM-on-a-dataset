# SVM on a dataset

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the SVM on a Dataset project! This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook that showcases the implementation and analysis of Support Vector Machines (SVM) on a specific dataset.

## About the Project
This project focuses on utilizing Support Vector Machines, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to solve a classification problem. The main goal is to demonstrate how SVM can effectively classify data points into different classes by finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes. The Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository takes you through the entire process, from data preprocessing and feature selection to model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
